# Face Recognition
The goal is to re-train MobileNet for facial recognition, convert the trained model for microcontrollers and test the accuracy / latency / power parameters.

## Testing the model before quantization:
Accuracy = 100%
Latency = 200ms

## Dataset:
Image Size: 96x96x3
Contains two categories: Het / Prashant
Train Images: 242
Validation Images : 158
Test Images : 200
